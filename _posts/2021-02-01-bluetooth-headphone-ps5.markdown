Are you thinking about getting a PS5 but frustrated with Sony for not
providing built in bluetooth capability for you to connect your favorite
bluetooth headphones? Or maybe you already got a PS5 and are still frustrated
about this. One would think that a game system created in 2020 would be able
to seamlessly connect to other bluetooth audio devices and their mics, especially because
bluetooth technology is cheap and very prevalent these days. However, Sony announced in its
recent Playstation FAQ that "Wireless headsets from third-party companies that use a Bluetooth connection
will not be supported on PS5, though most USB and analog headsets will be supported."

It doesn't seem like there is much logic in their decision to do this,
but perhaps they have some financial incentive in not
providing it? Maybe it's because Sony wants to coerce their users into buying
their own, expensive gaming headset, the Sony Pulse 3D Wireless Gaming Headset? If money isn't a big
concern for you, then I would suggest purchasing this headset, except you would still have the downside
of owning a separate, somewhat large headset that you only use for gaming. If this doesn't matter to you
then the convenience of use and quality of sound make the [Sony Pulse](https://amzn.to/3pn2lok) an obvious purchase.

But what about the rest of us gamers who like to play online multi-player games,
such as Fortnite, Call of Duty, GTA, Fifa, 2k and Madden online with our friends,
but don't want to keep a separate headset around just for gaming when we
already have a perfectly good pair of wireless earbuds? Anyways, you're probably reading this
because you're looking for a solution to this problem, not just to hear some random guy
rant about how annoying it is. A solution that I found from looking
online is to use something called a Blueooth Audio Transmitter.

This is a device that you can plug into either a usb-c, or usb input on your game console,
and it can pair with your bluetooth headset. It's supposed to send audio both in and out of the game.
So if it works properly, you should be able to hear your friends and speak to your friends after pairing.
I personally bought the [1mii miilink bluetooth adapter](https://amzn.to/3jNFTni) from Amazon. I bought it for around $25.

I know it's annoying to spend this extra money, but after dropping dough on a PS5, I definitely recommend splurging on this
to make your gaming experience much more pleasant. It is advertised to work for both PS5 and Nintendo Switch,
but from my experiments on my personal Nintendo Switch and PS5, I saw that everything worked fine when connected
to the Nintendo Switch, but when connected to the PS5, only the audio works and not the microphone.
This means that you can hear your teammates but they can't hear you.

I tested it using my airpod pros, but after looking at online forums I came to the conclusion that the microphone
for the airpods won't work even after using an audio transmitter. I only tested this with one audio transmitter,
so it could be I have a flawed experience. It is possible that both the sound and the microphone for your airpods
or other bluetooth headset work with your ps5 out the box, but if you run into the same scenario that I did, then
I still have a solution for you. I'll go through the setup step-by-step, with images below.

First, take your audio transmitter out of the box. Here is what the one I bought looks like. ![miilink device]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/miilink_solo.jpeg). You can plug it into the usb-c port on the side of the ps5. Here is an image of where the usb-c port is located. ![PS5 usb-c port]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/ps5_sideview.jpeg). Here is what it looks like after plugging it in: ![PS5 miilink]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/ps5_miilink_plugged_in.jpeg)
Follow the instructions on the device to pair it with your bluetooth headset. In the Playstation5 settings, you are able to select both the device to use for audio input and the device to use for audio output. If the microphone for your bluetooth headset isn't working, you can switch the audio input device to be your dualshock controller because the new PS5 controllers have a built in microphone. You can
change this setting in two different ways. The long way is to go to the PS5 home, click settings->Sound. In the "Microphone" tab,
click "Input Device" and select "Microphone on Controller", as show in image below. ![PS5 Sound Microphone Setting]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/ps5_sound_microphone_setting.jpeg) This will change the microphone to use your controller instead of the bluetooth audio device.
In the "Audio Output" tab, make sure that "Output Device" is set to "USB Headset", as seen in image below.
change the audio input device to your controller and the output device to your wireless headset, as in the image
below. ![PS5 Audio output setting]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/ps5_sound_audio_output_setting.jpeg)

There is also a shortcut to do this, by clicking playstation button in the center of the controller and
selecting the sound icon or microphone icon to change the respective devices. ![PS5 microphone setting shortcut]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/ps5_mic_shortcut.jpeg)

![PS5 audio output setting shortcut]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/ps5_audio_output_shortcut.jpeg)
The benefit of this shortcut, is you can change the setting quickly, without needing to leave your current game.

With this approach, I'm able to hear my friends using my airpods and they can hear me through the dualshock controller. I'm now finally able to get rid of my shitty, old pair of wired headphones and can just use a single pair of headphones for gaming and all of my other audio needs.

I hope you enjoy this post and that it helps someone get over this frustrating downside to the PS5.

# Warning:

If you use a bluetooth audio transmitter, like the one I discussed above, then it is likely that it will automatically try to connect to your bluetooth headset whenever the PS5 is turned on and the bluetooth transmitter is plugged in. This can be annoying because you might want to use your bluetooth device with your phone on a phone call and the PS5 might mess with that connection. As a solution to this problem, either turn off your PS5 when you're not using it or unplug the bluetooth transmitter when you're not using it.
